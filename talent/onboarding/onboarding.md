## Onboarding Process

- This document describes the onboarding process for a new source{d} member.

### Guide 

- Read the source{d} [guide](https://github.com/src-d/guide) which contains all the information necessary from the moment you accept an offer. 

### Hardware

- A few days before you start working with us, you choose the hardware you would like to use from on the [list](https://github.com/src-d/guide/blob/master/general/available_hardware.md) with the hardware we provide. 
- The first day we present it to you, so you are able to create your working environment as soon as possible.

### Accounts 

- From the first day you have access to source{d} Google Account, while receiving invitations to join the applications we are using:
* Slack: the main communication channel we are using. Click [here](https://github.com/src-d/guide/blob/master/communication/slack_channels.md) for more information. 
* GitHub source{d}: you are added to our GitHub organization. The lead of your team is responsible to explain the repositories you need to be notified of and how to treat them.
* Lever: it's a platform to support our hiring process. Everyone has access to it in order to be able to review and give feedback on candidates. 
* Kin HR: if you want to ask days off that's the right place to do it. Also, every month you will receive the invoice of your payment through the platform. 
* Google Calendar: here are hosted all the events. Give to our Office Manager access to your calendar in order to add the events to it. Make sure you check your calendar frequently. 

- The above are the main tools we are using, but we do have a full [list](https://github.com/src-d/guide/blob/master/general/tools.md).

### Welcome Talks 

- During your first week you are going to have Welcome Talks in order to get to know source{d} and every team better:
* Welcome talks with the Founders
* Welcome talk with the CTO
* Welcome talk with the Product Manager

### Office

- At the office, we provide:

* Kitchen with refrigerator and microwaves. Coffee, milk, fruits, drinks, ice creams etc.
* HTC Vive VR Headset, Xbox One and Nintendo 64 with a nice catalog of games. 
* Boxes to store your personal items.

- In case you don't know how to use any of the electronics feel free to ask the person who might there with you. 
- For any issues you may notice in terms of condition or lacking supplies, please contact our Office Manager.

### Company Events

- We regularly organize [company events](https://github.com/src-d/guide/blob/master/office/company_events.md) and you will be notified about them on your Google Calendar. 

### Remote 

- As you know, source{d} is fully remote friendly, what this means is that you can choose to be full-time remote from the location of your choice or be in our Madrid office. For smooth collaboration, we have everything written down in our [guideline](https://github.com/src-d/guide/blob/master/remote/remote_guidelines.md).

### Rooms 

- There are three rooms that you are able to use for your meetings: Ada Lovelace, Dennis Ritchie, and Alan Turing. 
- Every room contains a camera, microphone, and screens you are able to use if you have remote meetings. Also, you will notice small tablets, that allow you to connect easily through Zoom. 
- We are using Google Calendar with the room names to book them in order to avoid any conflicts. 

### Meetings

- Notes of meetings should be taken at every meeting (with very few exceptions) to allow for transparency to the people who attended to it as well as to those who haven't attended to it. All of them are stored in our private repo minutes. 

### GeekBot

- On Slack we have GeekBot which asks on daily basis a few questions like what you accomplished the previous day, what are you going to work on today and where are you working from. Then bot displays your response in the relevant Slack channels. It actually organises asynchronous stand up meetings and keeps our team synced. As people work on different things or/and from different places, it's helps us being transparent and know what everyone is doing. 

### Arriving time 

- For the people that work from the office, the time to arrive is flexible. In general, most people arrive between 9.30-11am.
