# Expenses & Travel

We don't like to put strict rules in terms of what you can expense and what not, because we believe that you will treat the company's money in a responsible way. An easy wway to achieve this is by following these principles:<br>
* Spend source{d}'s money as if it was your own.
* Research all available alternatives to make sure you're getting the best value for money.
* Always ask your manager first before making a purchase. He might be able to point you to a better solution.
* Once the decision has been made please request Esther to make the purchase, so that she can keep track of inventory as well as keep the receipt.
* If you need any hardware for work, make sure to check our [Hardware list](https://github.com/src-d/guide/blob/master/general/available_hardware.md) and ask Esther to buy anything you need.
* If you see yourself in the situation of needing to pay something out of your own pocket please make sure that you keep all the receipts and hand them over to Esther for her to do the reimbursement. If it's a physical item, make sure to give it to her when you receive it for her to update the inventory.
  
## What expenses will source{d} reimburse?
* Mileage will be paid according to X when driving your own car to a work meeting outside of the office.
* Public transportation or Cabify/Uber/Lyft/Taxis taken to work related meetings/events.
* Meals that are work related. Meals with other sourcerers are not included here.
* Books, online courses, conferences or anything else related to education.

## What expenses are covered when travelling?
* Lodging, which will be organized by Esther. If you decide to stay with family or friends we will pay you 50% of what your lodging would've cost!
* Plane/Train/Bus tickets, which will be purchased by Esther. Please let her know with as much time in advance as possible so that she can find the best deals.
* Meals will be reimbursed. Here again, try to follow the principle of spending the money as if it was your own.
* If you want to take some holidays and stay any extra days in a concrete location it's totally fine, but source{d} will only cover the costs of the days you stayed there for work. Any increase in the price of the plane ticket will also need to be covered by you.
