# Community Events

## source{d} tech talks

Our tech talks are one-day conferences held in Madrid at our offices, or elsewhere, where we invite up to 7-8 speakers to talk to us about a very advanced topic related with Infrastructure, Machine Learning, Frontend & more (suggestions are always more than welcome)!
You can check all past events [here](http://talks.sourced.tech/) and all talks, as we record everything.

When we organise such events, we expect the team which is closer to the topic of the event to closely help organising it. That means that for Frontend, for example, the entire platform team is responsible for choosing and inviting the speakers, approving their talks and hosting the event on its actual day (exceptions will exist of course, but this would be the ideal case).

The Community team will however support with all the speakers logistics, the venue, F&B, promotion materials, sponsors, communication and social media, etc.

These events usually count around 100 attendees.


## Meetups at the office

Thanks to Maximo, we host the [GoMAd](https://www.meetup.com/es-ES/go-mad/) meetup on a monthly basis here at the office!

On a less frequent basis, we host any meetup that asks us to - if you know anyone looking for a venue for a <75 people event feel free to suggest the back of our office. Besides, depending on the occasion, we'd be happy to sponsor drinks and pizzas/snakcs for them too!


## Beer Payback's

As we try to aim for consistency, we are calling any conference side events 'beer payback'. It's not the best name, and suggestions, again, are welcome, but it's what we have at the moment. 

Beer payback's are usually events that we organise abroad, next to conferences that the team is attending and which crowd would be great to engage closely with. We've done so at:
- FOSDEM, Brussels
- MSR, Buenos Aires


### Besides the above three types of events we help organise, we're always on the lookout for CFP to submit and get anyone from the team speaking at third-parties events that could be interesting to reach and attend. This is strongly encouraged from anyone in the team and something that we cover expenses for (if said conference doesn't already).
