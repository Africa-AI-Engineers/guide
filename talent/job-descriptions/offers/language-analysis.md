Software Engineer in the Language Analysis team
------------------------------------------

### [Engineering at source{d}](../engineering-section.md)

### Role 

- The Language Analysis team is developing source{d} tools and libraries for
generating and processing abstract syntax trees for programming languages. These
components are integrated into the awesome open source project -
https://github.com/bblfsh, written in Go, C++, Scala, and really any other
language that we're parsing. Babelfish powers the cutting-edge research that the
Machine Learning team does on their ambitious mission to provide AI on code. Our
tools are being used by a community of developers, researchers, and
companies worldwide in order to do vanguard research or build the next
generation of developer tools and experiences.

- Being passionate about programming languages is important as well as an interest in
the lexing/parsing/semantic analysis of programming language's interpreters and
compilers. You'll be expected be experienced programming in at least two
languages and have strong good algorithmic skills. Our main language is Go, but prior experience is not a requirement; we strongly believe that it can be learned easily by any
skilled developer and care a lot more about our team's mindset and prior
experience than any specific languages. Modern C++ knowledge and experience would
be a plus.

- If you are interested in how we do code reviews, please take a look at the
PRs on these projects since all of our projects are open-source.
