# Stock Option Plan
This is the place where you will find all the information regarding our Stock Option Plan.

At source{d} we award stock options to some of our team members.<br>
Stock Options are a way to give you equity in the company without going through all the legal hassle and cost of giving out common stock.<br>
When you start working with us you will receive an award letter which grants you the options that are ruled by our Stock Option Plan.<br>
### Award letter
Here you can find a template of our Award Letter. It contains the following information:<br>
* Award date. This is important to know when the vesting starts counting.
* Number of options you will receive.
* Strike Price. The way options work is that when an Exit (IPO, Sale of the company or merger) happens you will be given the difference between the strike price per share and the price per share paid in the exit. It is standard among startups for the strike price to be 80% of the price
