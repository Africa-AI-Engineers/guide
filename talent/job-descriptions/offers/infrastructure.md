Software Engineer in the Infrastructure team
------------------------------------------

### [Company](../company-section.md)

### [Engineering at source{d}](../engineering-section.md)

### Role 

- The Infrastructure team focuses on building our computation cluster. This allows us to run large scale computation algorithms and store the required information for those computations.

- Our cluster, with close to 2000 threads, more than 11TB of RAM and 1PB of storage, is backed by CoreOS and Kubernetes. It has two main goals: on the one hand, it stores all the available public code in a HDFS cluster and on the other hand, it runs intensive computation jobs over the stored data on top of Spark. 

- Besides the main points above, the Infrastructure team is also in charge of several other important services, such as databases, queues, CI, monitorization, loging, etc.

- At source{d}, we really care about open source,which is why we contribute to projects like Terraform & CoreOS, as well as creating our own projects across different teams at source{d}.

- We are looking for someone with a strong Linux background, good Networking knowledge, passion for automation and experience working at scale. Finally, knowledge of at least one backend/scripting language and caring about best development practices are required.
