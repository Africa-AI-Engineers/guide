- At source{d} we are building the stack for the next generation of Machine Learning powered developer tools.

- We have raised over eight million USD so far, and we are currently growing our team.

- Our current monetization strategy is based on deploying our stack and tooling within large tech companies.

## TEAM

- Engineering consists of five different teams, that mimic the architecture of our product:

- Applications (Scala, Go and Python and Frontend tools): Builds CLI/Web applications based on ML research.
- Machine Learning (C++ and Python): R&D of machine learning on source code.
- Data Retrieval (Scala and Go): Builds the technology that finds, fetches, stores and analyzes over +60M Git repositories.
- Language Analysis (Go and another +15): Works on Babelfish, the universal code parsing server.
- Infrastructure (Go and Python): Manages on-prem bare metal servers with Kubernetes and CoreOS.

## ROLE

The Language Analysis team is developing source{d} tools and libraries for
generating and processing abstract syntax trees for programming languages. These
components are integrated into the awesome open source project -
https://github.com/bblfsh, written in Go, C++, Scala, and really any other
language that we're parsing. Babelfish powers the cutting-edge research that the
Machine Learning team does on their ambitious mission to provide AI on code. Our
tools are being used by a community of developers, researchers, and
companies worldwide in order to do vanguard research or build the next
generation of developer tools and experiences.

Being passionate about programming languages is important as well as an interest in
the lexing/parsing/semantic analysis of programming language's interpreters and
compilers. You'll be expected be experienced programming in at least two
languages and have strong good algorithmic skills. Our main language is Go, but prior experience is not a requirement; we strongly believe that it can be learned easily by any
skilled developer and care a lot more about our team's mindset and prior
experience than any specific languages. Modern C++ knowledge and experience would
be a plus.

If you are interested in how we do code reviews, please take a look at the
PRs on these projects since all of our projects are open-source.

## CULTURE

- source{d} is a company for developers by developers. We firmly believe in always doing what's best for the community, not necessarily companies. "For developers" is the answer to any strategic question or dilemma in the company. Always For Developers.

- "By developers" is our identity. Everyone in the company is either a developer or has a developer/engineering mindset. We don't hire anyone who doesn't fit into this culture, it's the only way to make sure everyone understands developers and can always defend their interest.

- At the moment, we are 20+ people from 10 different countries working closely together from our office in Madrid, Spain. We are more than happy to sponsor you a visa and guide you and your family through the whole process if you decide to come to work from our office, but you may also choose to work remotely as part of our team does working from Portugal, Estonia, Russia, and others.

- At source{d}, we have a transparent salary policy. Depending on your experience, you can either join us as a Senior Engineer or a Lead. For a Senior Engineer, the salary ranges from €49.000 to €53.000. You can find our net amounts at https://cincodias.elpais.com/herramientas/calculadora-sueldo-neto/ (in Spanish only).

- Following the same level of transparency as with development process, all the above aspects of the work culture are documented and publicly available in our Guide at https://github.com/src-d/guide/.
