- At source{d} we are building the stack for the next generation of Machine Learning powered developer tools.

- We have raised over eight million USD so far, and we are currently growing our team.

- Our current monetization strategy is based on deploying our stack and tooling within large tech companies.

## TEAM

- Engineering consists of five different teams, that mimic the architecture of our product:

- Applications (Scala, Go and Python and Frontend tools): Builds CLI/Web applications based on ML research.
- Machine Learning (C++ and Python): R&D of machine learning on source code.
- Data Retrieval (Scala and Go): Builds the technology that finds, fetches, stores and analyzes over +60M Git repositories.
- Language Analysis (Go and another +15): Works on Babelfish, the universal code parsing server.
- Infrastructure (Go and Python): Manages on-prem bare metal servers with Kubernetes and CoreOS.

## ROLE

- The Infrastructure team focuses on building our computation cluster. This allows us to run large scale computation algorithms and store the required information for those computations.

- Our cluster, with close to 2000 threads, more than 11TB of RAM and 1PB of storage, is backed by CoreOS and Kubernetes. It has two main goals: on the one hand, it stores all the available public code in a HDFS cluster and on the other hand, it runs intensive computation jobs over the stored data on top of Spark. 

- Besides the main points above, the Infrastructure team is also in charge of several other important services, such as databases, queues, CI, monitorization, loging, etc.

- At source{d}, we really care about open source,which is why we contribute to projects like Terraform & CoreOS, as well as creating our own projects across different teams at source{d}.

- We are looking for someone with a strong Linux background, good Networking knowledge, passion for automation and experience working at scale. Finally, knowledge of at least one backend/scripting language and caring about best development practices are required. 

## CULTURE

- source{d} is a company for developers by developers. We firmly believe in always doing what's best for the community, not necessarily companies. "For developers" is the answer to any strategic question or dilemma in the company. Always For Developers.

- "By developers" is our identity. Everyone in the company is either a developer or has a developer/engineering mindset. We don't hire anyone who doesn't fit into this culture, it's the only way to make sure everyone understands developers and can always defend their interest.

- At the moment, we are 20+ people from 10 different countries working closely together from our office in Madrid, Spain. We are more than happy to sponsor you a visa and guide you and your family through the whole process if you decide to come to work from our office, but you may also choose to work remotely as part of our team does working from Portugal, Estonia, Russia, and others.

- At source{d}, we have a transparent salary policy which we feel strongly about it. Although a seniority level for every candidate will be determined during the last round of on-site interviews, one can expect that for a Senior Engineer salary ranges from €49.000 to €53.000. You can find our net amounts [here](https://cincodias.elpais.com/herramientas/calculadora-sueldo-neto/) (in Spanish only).

- Following the same level of transparency as with development process, all the above aspects of the work culture are documented and publicly available in our Guide at https://github.com/src-d/guide/.
