### Role

This position is for a Lead Engineer in the Applications team.

- As a Lead Engineer, you will be expected to plan current and future work, provide mentorship, overseeing progress of the team and, in general, be able to make day-to-day work smooth for everyone in the team.

- In terms of coding, you will have a two-fold role: on one hand it's a Data Engineering, building production-level pipelines to collect and extract data from all the git repositories in the world. On the other hand, building web applications to productionize Machine Learning research on both, backend and frontend sides.

- You will be expected to have strong backend coding skills in at least one programming language and very good algorithmic skills. Scala coding skills and knowledge about Apache Spark aren't required but will be highly appreciated.

- Building tools for day to day use by software engineers require good understanding of modern development processes and approaches: Unit/Integration testing, scrum, code reviews, CI/CD, Containers, etc.

- As you will be working closely with the Machine Learning team - strong communication skills and interest in Machine Learning, data process, and visualization are more than welcome. 

- You will deal with models built using modern ML stacks written in Python and C++ such as Tensorflow, Tensorboard, so familiarity with any of those tools is a plus.

- You will have a major role in the hiring proces, including screening candidates, initial calls, coding challenge reviews etc.
