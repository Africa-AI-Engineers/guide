<h1>Donut</h1>

One potential downside of being a remote company is that sourceres don't have as many opportunities to have sporadic, informal conversations to get to know each other better.<br>
In order to solve this partially, we use Donut for Slack. Donut is a Slack plugin that will match you up with someone from the company every two weeks to have a videocall or to meet in the Kitchen of the Madrid or SF office. This provides the opportunity for people to get to know each other better<br>
All you have to do to opt-in is join the #sourcerers-matchup channel and you will get an invite for every Monday at 10:00AM. It's the perfect time to also talk about the weekend ;)<br>
