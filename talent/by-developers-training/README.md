# "By Developers" Training

As you've read in our Culture section, we're a company "For Developers". In order to achieve this everyone needs to be able to put themselves in the shoes of a developer by becoming one themselves.
The purpose of this document is to provide a guide on how to acquire an engineering mindset through learning the basics of Computer Science and coding. Each sourcerer should block a 1-hour slot every day in their calendars to dedicate to this program. The total length of the program is 21 weeks.

You will be assigned a mentor who will be able to help you with questions and problems. This mentor will be either someone from the engineering team or someone who has finished the program before already.


## Quest 1: Setup your machine on Arch Linux

**Why:** By getting a good understanding of Linux you'll understand better how a computer works and you'll get to use sites like Stack Overflow on a frequent basis, which will allow you to get a better picture of the developer community.

**Process:** Follow all the steps on the Arch Linux Setup documentation to fully set up your laptop. If you have questions on how to do something first google your question and try to find solutions to it on ArchLinux, StackOverflow or other sites. If you find yourself unable to solve your problem ask your mentor for help. When doing so, try to recollect the queries you used to look for the problem on the internet. This way, your mentor will help to improve the most important technique you’ll need while coding: your _google-fu_.

You should have received an invitation to Enki. Enroll in the Linux track and make sure you train every day, during the slot you have blocked, to become better at it and so you don't forget what you've learned.

**Duration:** 2 days

**Resources:**

* [Arch Linux Setup](https://github.com/src-d/tutorial/blob/master/talent/by-developers-training/linux.md)
* [Unix Cheat Sheet](http://cheatsheetworld.com/programming/unix-linux-cheat-sheet/)

## Quest 4: Learning Python

**Why:** Now that you know the theory it's time for you to get your hands dirty and learn how to code. This track won't teach you how to become a developer, but rather how to code to be more efficient in your day to day.

**Process:** Reading through the book “Automate the Boring Stuff with Python”

**Duration:** 3 weeks
