### Role

This internship targets students and junior engineers who are interested in the field of machine learning on source code. The start and duration of the internship is discussed on an individual basis.

- Strong computer science and machine learning background is essential for machine learning team members. 

- You will be expected to be a passionate, skilful engineer who is able to produce amazing results quickly and reliably. 

- Coding skills are important; we are using Python 3 in our research and production prototyping. Besides, we occasionally code in Go, C++ and CUDA but prior knowledge of these languages is not required for the internship. 

- Machine learning om source code shares common ideas with Natural Language Processing, so NLP knowledge is considered a plus.

- Any deep learning experience is highly appreciated.
