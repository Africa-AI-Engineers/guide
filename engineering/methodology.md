# Engineering Methodology

Date: 2016-09-21

## Intro

These are the notes from 2016-09-12 Scrum/OKR meeting for the Engineering team
at source{d}.

## OKR

- Officially, engineering grunts will not have Objectives, although they can
  create their own.  This has to do with how to mix SCRUM and OKRs properly.
  The details about this are still not defined, @mcuadros has to talk with
  @jorgeschnura to see how to best fit SCRUM and OKR.

## SCRUM

- We will be having different SCRUMS per team, although as we are so few, some
  we are having some meetings all together (e. g. standups)

- Sprints will last 2 weeks.

- The product owner will be @mcuadros

- Standup meetings at 10:30AM. Right now they will be with all engineering. When all the teams have all their members every team will have their own standup meeting.

- Planning meetings

  + Each team will have their own.

  + Data Science and Devops will have their planning meeting on Mondays.

  + Tools and Data Retrieval on Tuesdays.

  + It is really a planing DAY, not just a meeting:

    * There will be a 1 hour long kickoff meeting at 10:00 (first team) and
      11:00 (second team)

    * The rest of the day, the team will think about proposed sprint plan and
      decide if it is doable.

    * There will be a close meeting at 17:30 (first) and 18:00 (second) to confirm
      the sprint plan.

  + All OKR objectives for each team member will be covered in the planning.

- Demo

  + At the end of each sprint: Fridays 15:30.

  + Company Wide.

  + Product does not need to be deployed, but the demo should be as real as
    possible.

- Deploying

  + Deploying may not make sense for some teams, i. e. Data Science and Devops.

  + Tools and Data Retrieval will deploy on Mondays after the end of an sprint,
    as they don't have the planing meeting until Tuesday.

- Retrospectives

  + Starting at the end of the second sprint, one every other sprint.

  + On Fridays after the sprint demo.

- Keeping track of things:

  + Publicly: Physical Kanban on some wall.

  + Per team: any way the see fit (github issues, github projects, waffle.io...).

- What does it mean something is done?

  + Team by team answer.

- Redirect people requests uphill to avoid getting unplanned work during the
  sprints.
