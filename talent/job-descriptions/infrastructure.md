- "Delivering AI on Code" - source{d} is building the tech stack for large-scale machine learning on source code (MLoSC). We treat source code a first-class analyzable asset: by fetching and storing tens of millions of repositories from millions of developers around the world, processing and analyzing it with source{d} engine and Babelfish in order to build Machine Learning models. We make building blocks for the next generation of developer tools & systems that will change the way we learn, write & review code.

- source{d} has raised a $6M round last summer and is rapidly growing team while preparing for the next round. We monetize by deploying our stack and applications at top tech companies. 

## TEAM

- Engineering department consists of five different teams, stacking up on each other:

- Applications (Scala, Go and Python and Frontend tools), Builds CLI/Web applications based on ML research.
- Machine Learning (Go and Python), R&D of new ML models over the source code.
- Data Retrieval (Scala and Go), Finds, fetches, stores and analyze over  +60M Git repositories.
- Language Analysis (Go and another +15), Parses source code from different languages.
- Infrastructure (Go), Manages on-prem bare metal servers with Kubernetes and CoreOS.


## ROLE

- The Infrastructure team focuses on building our computation cluster. This allows us to run large scale computation algorithms and store the required information for those computations.

- Our cluster, with close to 2000 threads, more than 11TB of RAM and 1PB of storage, is backed by CoreOS and Kubernetes. It has two main goals: on the one hand, it stores all the available public code in a HDFS cluster and on the other hand, it runs intensive computation jobs over the stored data on top of Spark. 

- Besides the main points above, the Infrastructure team is also in charge of several other important services, such as databases, queues, CI, monitorization, loging, etc.

- At source{d}, we really care about open source,which is why we contribute to projects like Terraform & CoreOS, as well as creating our own projects across different teams at source{d}.

- We are looking for someone with strong background in Linux and knowledge of Networking to some extend. Finally, knowledge of at least one backend/scripting language and caring about best development practices are required. 


## CULTURE

- source{d} is a company for developers by developers. We firmly believe in always doing what's best for the community, not necessarily companies. "For developers" is the answer to any strategic question or dilemma in the company. Always For Developers.

- "By developers" is our identity. Everyone in the company is either a developer or has a developer/engineering mindset. We don't hire anyone who doesn't fit into this culture, it's the only way to make sure everyone understands developers and can always defend their interest.

- At the moment, we are 20+ people from 10 different countries working closely together from our office in Madrid, Spain. We are more than happy to sponsor you a visa and guide you and your family through the whole process if you decide to come to work from our office, but you may also choose to work remotely as part of our team does working from Portugal, Estonia, Russia, and others.

- At source{d}, we have a transparent salary policy which we feel strongly about it. Depending on your experience, you can either join us as a Senior Engineer or a Lead. For a Senior Engineer, the salary ranges from €49.000 to €53.000. You can find our net amounts here (in Spanish only).

- Following the same level of transparency as with development process, all the above aspects of the work culture are documented and publicly available in our Guide at https://github.com/src-d/guide/.
