- At source{d} we are building the stack for the next generation of machine-learning powered developer tools.

- source{d} raised over $8MM till date and we are currently growing our team. 

- We monetize by deploying our stack and tooling within large tech companies.

## TEAM

- Engineering consists of five different teams, that mimic the architecture of our product:

- Applications (Scala, Go and Python and Frontend tools): Builds CLI/Web applications based on ML research.
- Machine Learning (C++ and Python): R&D of machine learning on source code.
- Data Retrieval (Scala and Go): Builds the technology that finds, fetches, stores and analyzes over +60M Git repositories.
- Language Analysis (Go and another +15): Works on Babelfish, the universal code parsing server.
- Infrastructure (Go and Python): Manages on-prem bare metal servers with Kubernetes and CoreOS.


## ROLE

- The Data Retrieval team is developing source{d}'s audacious high-level Engine for running scalable data retrieval pipelines that process and manipulate any number of code repositories for source code analysis. Written mostly in Scala, it aims to be robust, friendly and flexible: it is built on top of Apache Spark, accessible both via Scala and Python Spark APIs, and capable of running on large-scale distributed clusters over petabytes of data.

- We at source{d} seek to be at the heart of any project related to source code. Thus, this core tool will be used both in-house for building source{d}'s unique global scale open dataset of +60M code repositories for cutting-edge machine learning research, as well as used externally by empowering a wide community of developers, researchers and companies worldwide when doing vanguard research or building the next generation of developer tools and experiences.

- Good knowledge of distributed computing and parallel processing is important. You will be expected to have strong backend coding skills in at least two languages and very good algorithmic skills. Scala coding skills and knowledge about Apache Spark aren't required but will be highly appreciated, in the other hand Go is not a strict requirement; we strongly believe that it can be learned easily by any skilled developer and care a lot more about our team's mindset and prior experience than any specific skills.

- We really care about open source, you can easily check a couple of our Data Retrieval team's projects below:
- src-d/engine: running scalable pipelines that process any number of Git repositories
- go-git: a low level and highly extensible Git implementation in pure Go
- śiva: seekable indexed block archiver format
- go-billy: the missing interface to abstract several storages

- If you are interested on how we do the code reviews, please take a look at the PRs on these projects since we use the same workflow as for private ones.


## CULTURE

- source{d} is a company for developers by developers. We firmly believe in always doing what's best for the community, not necessarily companies. "For developers" is the answer to any strategic question or dilemma in the company. Always For Developers.

- "By developers" is our identity. Everyone in the company is either a developer or has a developer/engineering mindset. We don't hire anyone who doesn't fit into this culture, it's the only way to make sure everyone understands developers and can always defend their interest.

- At the moment, we are 20+ people from 10 different countries working closely together from our office in Madrid, Spain. We are more than happy to sponsor you a visa and guide you and your family through the whole process if you decide to come to work from our office, but you may also choose to work remotely as part of our team does working from Portugal, Estonia, Russia, and others.

- At source{d}, we have a transparent salary policy. Depending on your experience, you can either join us as a Senior Engineer or a Lead. For a Senior Engineer, the salary ranges from €49.000 to €53.000. You can find our net amounts here (in Spanish only).

- Following the same level of transparency as with development process, all the above aspects of the work culture are documented and publicly available in our Guide at https://github.com/src-d/guide/.
