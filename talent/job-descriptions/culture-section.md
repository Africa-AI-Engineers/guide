- source{d} is a company for developers by developers. We firmly believe in always doing what's best for the community, not necessarily companies. "For developers" is the answer to any strategic question or dilemma in the company. Always For Developers.

- "By developers" is our identity. Everyone in the company is either a developer or has a developer/engineering mindset. We don't hire anyone who doesn't fit into this culture, it's the only way to make sure everyone understands developers and can always defend their interest.

- At the moment, we are 20+ people from 10 different countries working closely together from our office in Madrid, Spain. We are more than happy to sponsor you a visa and guide you and your family through the whole process if you decide to come to work from our office, but you may also choose to work remotely as part of our team does working from Portugal, Estonia, Russia, and others.

- At source{d}, we have a transparent salary policy which we feel strongly about it. Although a seniority level for every candidate will be determined during the last round of on-site interviews, one can expect that for a Senior Engineer salary ranges from €49.000 to €53.000. You can find our net amounts [here](https://cincodias.elpais.com/herramientas/calculadora-sueldo-neto/) (in Spanish only).

- Following the same level of transparency as with development process, all the above aspects of the work culture are documented and publicly available in our Guide at https://github.com/src-d/guide/.
