# Flexible Holidays, Working Schedule and Remote Work

At source{d} we believe in freedom and treating everyone as adults. If you're committed to what we can achieve together and love your job you don't need anyone forcing you to work in one certain way or another.

### Holiday Policy

At source{d} you will have 23 days of holidays to use however you wish. This means that you can take them whenever you want, just let everyone know with as much time as possible so people can plan in advance.

Unlike in some other companies we don't count the weekends of bank holidays that fall inside of your holidays. This means that if you take two weeks off it will count as 10 holidays (2x Monday-Friday). This is the norm in most countries but some companies in some countries also count the weekend in between as part of your holidays.

You can also work during bank holidays or weekends and exchange those days for additional holidays. You just have to let your team know that you are going to do so. Again, try to do it with time so that everyone can plan accordingly.

Finally, if you don't use all your days in one year, any unused days will carry over to the next.

### Working Schedule

This is very simple, there is none. You can come and go as you please as long as you get your work done and don't miss any of your meetings. Once you're here you'll see that some people come in very early and others very late, some leave early and others leave late. Everyone needs to be responsible enough to manage their own time and schedule.

### Working Remotely

We are very flexible with people working remotely. If you want to work from home any day you just need to let your team know with as much time in advance as possible so they can accomodate to that. Unless you have any in-person meetings that you need to attend we don't have any problem with this if you feel you'll be more productive this way. We always suggest though to try to spend as much time with the team as possible as it creates strong bonds and makes for a more united team.
