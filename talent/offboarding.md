This document describes the off-boarding process at source{d}.
We believe that the off-boarding process should be smooth and clear in order to cause minimal disruption to every including member.

The relationship with the company can finish in three different ways. 

#### The employee decides to leave

- The employee has to tell the company (usually) 15 days in advance. 
- The employee has to sign a resignation letter with their information and the end date. Example. 
- The company has to give the accountant the following information to prepare the settlement: 
  - End date.
  - Type of leaving: voluntary severance.
  - Holidays to enjoy:the office manager has to check in Kin HR. 

- The accountant is going to send us the following documents:
  - Payslip for the current month
  - Finiquito / settlement: in this case only include the holidays to enjoy
  - Certificado de empresa: show the last 180 days working in the company. 
  - Parte de baja:  it’s the communication to the Social security office which says that the employee is not working anymore in the company. 


When every document is signed, the last day, the office manager has to:
- Upload the documents to the employee’s profile in Kin HR. 
- Change the employment status to “resigned” and add the end date.
- Close slack account and gmail account. The Team leader has to close the different accounts which the employee used. 
- Check the hardware which the employee was working with. The employee has to give back all the equipment.  
- Pay the amount for the payslip. 
- Delete their fingerprint from the lector.
