- "Delivering AI on Code" - source{d} is building the tech stack for large-scale machine learning on source code (MLoSC). We treat source code a first-class analyzable asset: by fetching and storing tens of millions of repositories from millions of developers around the world, processing and analyzing it with source{d} engine and Babelfish in order to build Machine Learning models. We make building blocks for the next generation of developer tools & systems that will change the way we learn, write & review code.

- source{d} has raised a $6M round last summer and is rapidly growing team while preparing for the next round. We monetize by deploying our stack and applications at top tech companies. 

## TEAM

- Engineering department consists of five different teams, stacking up on each other:

- Applications (Scala, Go and Python and Frontend tools), Builds CLI/Web applications based on ML research.
- Machine Learning (C++ and Python), R&D of new ML models over the source code.
- Data Retrieval (Scala and Go), Finds, fetches, stores and analyze over  +60M Git repositories.
- Language Analysis (Go and another +15), Parses source code from different languages.
- Infrastructure (Go and Python), Manages on-prem bare metal servers with Kubernetes and CoreOS.


## ROLE

The Language Analysis team is developing source{d} tools and libraries for
generating and processing abstract syntax trees for programming languages. These
components are integrated into the awesome open source project -
https://github.com/bblfsh, written in Go, C++, Scala, and really any other
language that we're parsing, which powers the cutting-edge research that the
Machine Learning team does on their ambitious mission to provide AI on code. Our
tools are being used by a wide community of developers, researchers, and
companies worldwide in order to do vanguard research or build the next
generation of developer tools and experiences.

Being passionate about programming languages is important as well as interest in
the lexing/parsing/semantic analysis of programming language's interpreters and
compilers. You'll be expected to have strong coding skills in at least two
languages and very good algorithmic skills. Our main language is Go, but is not
a strict requirement; we strongly believe that it can be learned easily by any
skilled developer and care a lot more about our team's mindset and prior
experience than any specific skills. Modern C++ knowledge and experience would
be a plus.

If you are interested in how we do the code reviews, please take a look at the
PRs on these projects since we use the same workflow as for private ones.

## CULTURE

- source{d} is a company for developers by developers. We firmly believe in always doing what's best for the community, not necessarily companies. "For developers" is the answer to any strategic question or dilemma in the company. Always For Developers.

- "By developers" is our identity. Everyone in the company is either a developer or has a developer/engineering mindset. We don't hire anyone who doesn't fit into this culture, it's the only way to make sure everyone understands developers and can always defend their interest.

- At the moment, we are 20+ people from 10 different countries working closely together from our office in Madrid, Spain. We are more than happy to sponsor you a visa and guide you and your family through the whole process if you decide to come to work from our office, but you may also choose to work remotely as part of our team does working from Portugal, Estonia, Russia, and others.

- At source{d}, we have a transparent salary policy which we feel strongly about it. Depending on your experience, you can either join us as a Senior Engineer or a Lead. For a Senior Engineer, the salary ranges from €49.000 to €53.000. You can find our net amounts here (in Spanish only).

- Following the same level of transparency as with development process, all the above aspects of the work culture are documented and publicly available in our Guide at https://github.com/src-d/guide/.
