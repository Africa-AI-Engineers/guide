The relationship with the company can finish in two different ways. 

#### The employee decides to leave

- The employee has to inform the company (usually) 15 days in advance. 
- The employee has to sign a resignation letter with their information and the end date. [Example](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6AGEF9RyVDxdEFULWx1dzNSd0E/view?usp=sharing). 
- The company has to give the accountant the following information to prepare the settlement: 
  - End date.
  - Type of leaving: voluntary severance.
  - Holidays to enjoy: the office manager has to check in Kin HR. 

- The accountant is going to send us the following documents:
  - Payslip for the current month
  - Finiquito / settlement: in this case only include the holidays to enjoy
  - Certificado de empresa: show the last 180 days working in the company. 
  - Parte de baja:  it’s the communication to the Social security office which says that the employee is not working anymore in the company. 


When every document is signed, the last day, the office manager has to:
- Upload the documents to the employee’s profile in Kin HR. 
- Change the employment status to “resigned” and add the end date.
- Close slack account and gmail account. The Team leader has to close the different accounts which the employee used. 
- Check the hardware which the employee was working with. The employee has to give back all the equipment.  
- Pay the amount for the payslip. 
- Delete their fingerprint from the lector. 
 
 
 
#### The company decides to fire the employee

There are three types of dismissal:
1. Objective: it’s based in economic or strategic reasons. The compensation will be 20 days per year worked.
2. Disciplinary: it’s based on disciplinary reason or on without reason. The compensation will be 33 days per year worked. It does not require prior notice, but an employer must notify the worker through a corresponding letter of dismissal, which states the facts prompting the dismissal and the effective date of the dismissal.
3. Collective. 

The challenge of the dismissals: Fair dismissal, unfair dismissal or invalid dismissal. The courts have to decide, not the company. 
For all the types, there are the following steps:
- The team leader has to tell the office manager when he wants to fire the employee to be able to prepare all the documents on time. 

- The company has to give the accountant the following information to prepare the settlement: 
  - End date.
  - Type of fire
  - Holidays to enjoy: the office manager has to check in Kin HR. 
  
- The accountant is going to send us the following documents:
  - Dismissal letter: the content of the letter is not 100% real, it'd be a standar letter for these cases becuase now, the company cannot say if the situation is an unfair dismissal or not. (2 copies)
  - Payslip for the current month (2 copies)
  - Finiquito / settlement: in this case only include the holidays to enjoy (2 copies)
  - Certificado de empresa: show the last 180 days working in the company. 
  - Parte de baja:  it’s the communication to the Social security office which says that the employee is not working anymore in the company. 
 

The Team leader should infomr the employee with someone else, if it is possible the office manager, so, they are able to explain to the employee all the documents and answer their questions. 

The employee has to sign the dismissal letter. If the employee doesn’t agree, he should sign and add “no conforme or N.C.”. 

When every document is signed, the last day, the office manager has to:
- Upload the documents to the employee’s profile in Kin HR. 
- Change the employment status to “terminated” and add the end date.
- Close slack account and gmail account. The Team leader has to close the different accounts which the employee used to use to work. 
- Check (in Kin HR) the hardware which the employee used to use to work. The employee has to give back all the equipment.  
- Pay the amount for the payslip. 
- Delete their fingerprint from the lector. 



If the employee doesn’t agree with the dismissal, he can request the impropriety of the dismissal in the court. To do that, the employee has to go to the SMAC (Servicio de Mediación, Arbitraje y Conciliación) with this [form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B6AGEF9RyVDxdEFULWx1dzNSd0E/view?usp=sharing). The SMAC is going to generate an appointment to talk about the compensation. The accountant will go to the appointment as a legal representant. If the company agrees, the same day, the office manage will pay the compensation. This would be the last step. 

Compensation for dismissal in Spain depends on three fundamental factors:
1. The salary of the employee: gross annual salary
2. The seniority of the employee within the company: when it comes to counting the seniority of the worker for compensation
3. Type of dismissal: currently, compensation is only for objective and unfair dismissals. A fair dismissal does not give the right to compensation, unless there is a settlement.
