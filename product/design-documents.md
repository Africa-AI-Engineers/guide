Design Documents
-----------------

At source{d} we use [design documents](../engineering/workflow.md#design-document-1st-iteration) to guide the product/engineering process. 

Important to note is that the term "Design Documents" does not necessarily have to do with graphic design. It is the term we use at source{d} for product documents that outline both design, business and engineering related information for a product / significant component of our technology stack.

They can be found in our internal Google Drive folder, [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1EwP0yC_3ixz0gumHBr_LIo3lefSzkRzF)
