# Applying at source{d} 

This document describes how the developers are able to apply at source{d} and the hiring process. 


### Visiting our careers page

- All the open roles can be found at https://sourced.tech/careers/ where the developer is able to apply to any desired role. 

- If there is not a fitting role, but the developer is interested in working with us, they could send an email to talent@sourced.tech with their GitHub account and a small intro about themselves. 

### Screening  

- In less than a week after the submission of the application the developer receives an email with feedback, however there can be delays. In any case, the developer is free to reach out to us at any moment at talent@sourced.tech.

- In case of positive feedback in the application, the developer is asked to move to a quick Skype/Zoom/Phone call with the lead of the team he applied to. 

### Skype/Zoom/Phone call  

- The developer is having a quick call with the lead engineer of the team he applied to. This should be a general discussion that can last between 15-30 minutes. It's purpose is to know the background and experience of the developer, as well as the developer to know source{d} better. It's expected that the developer has already done a basic research about source{d} and has specific questions about the role and/or the company to be expressed during the call. 

- There a noteable exceptions to this, such as higher volume junior roles where we directly ask the developer to do the coding challenge before a call.

### Coding Challenge

- Every developer who is passing successfuly the first interview, should complete the coding challege, remotely.

- The coding challenge can be solved in Go/Python/JavaScript/Scala/Ruby while the developer has already been asked.

- Unit tests are provided to validate the correctness of the solution.

- The time limit for solving the coding challenge is 5 hours. 

- We are expecting the solution either in a private Gist or in an attached file.

- The main point being reviewed is the correctness of the solution, however we do check the complexity and code style. 

- In case of the Data Science team, there is an additional ML task necessary to be solved in the time limit of 5 hours. 

- The results are being reviewed by the engineering team and feedback is given to the developer as soon as possible. 


### On-site Interview

- Every developer who successfuly solves the coding challenge, is invited for the last interview at our offices in Madrid. It might last a full day or be split across two half-days, depending on the availability of the developer.

- This is the last step in which it's decided if the candidate will receive an offer or not. 

The interviews are the followings:

- Kickoff with CTO, QA: to know the candidate better.

- Design interview: to see how the candidate would design a solution to a given technical problem working with a several of our engineers.

- Logical thinking: to see how the candidate solves an abstract problem in a logical way.

- In case of rejection, the candidate should be notified in person on the day by the lead of the corresponding team on why he was rejected. This should be a constructive discussion giving the candidate as much insights as possible. 

### Offer

- The offer is being sent by CTO on Lever. 

- The candidate has no time deadline to accept/reject the offer. Only in cases that we have more candidates in the offer state for one opening where decisions need to be made. 

### More 

- At source{d} we believe that amazing talent should not be constrained by physical barriers. Our multinational and multicultural team shares a culture of openness and excellence and passion for programming.

- At the moment, we are 20+ people from 10 different countries working closely together from our office in Madrid. We are more than happy to sponsor you a visa and guide you and your family through the whole process if you decide to come to work from our office, but you may also choose to work remotely as part of our team does working from Portugal, Estonia, Russia, and others.
