# Licensing Policy

This document describes the source{d} licensing policy for the open-source
projects.

All the project being developed or developed by source{d} should follow the
following rules.

## Licence

At the time of create a new project you can choose between two different
licenses:

- [GPL v3.0](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html), applied to projects which nature is specific to language analysis, machine learning and other core parts of our stack and may use it through a client library owned by us, allowing interaction with the project to third-party propietary code.


- [Apache License 2.0](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0), this license should be applied to projects which are libraries or tools that require direct interaction with third-party code, and the GPLv3 and variants don't allow it. _Some examples are: bblfsh/server or bblfsh/*-driver_

> Variants of GPLv3, such as AGPLv3 or LGPLv3 can be used under request and per case basis.

## Developer Certificate of Origin

All our projects should include a [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/) (DCO) document to protect us against any individual contributor revoking our rights to distribute their contribution to any of our project.

In practice, this means that every commit since the introduction of the DCO, should be signed off by the author, using `git commit -s`. Being irrelevant if the author is a source{d} employe or a individual contributor.

To learn more about DCO please read:
