- At source{d} we are building the stack for the next generation of Machine Learning powered developer tools.

- We have raised over eight million USD so far, and we are currently growing our team.

- Our current monetization strategy is based on deploying our stack and tooling within large tech companies.

## TEAM

- The Machine Learning team is focused on providing intelligent insights into nearly all the world's open source code. This includes typical big data analysis as well as solving sophisticated Machine Learning problems. The former is conducted on Apache Spark clusters with up to 1,000 nodes, the latter leverages extensive GPGPU acceleration on the custom hardware and Deep Learning techniques, standing on top of source{d}'s original open source projects and Tensorflow. Often, arising ML problems are unsupervised and require much research in the unusual domain of ML on source code (MLoSC).

- source{d} tries to be as open in it's ongoing research as possible. If a handy developed tool can be open-sourced then it has to be. If a solved interesting problem can be disclosed, it has to be published in source{d}'s blog. If a funny dataset is compiled, it is published on data.world. Writing papers is welcomed. We talk on conferences literally every month.

### To this moment, source{d}'s engineers have developed:

- [src-d/awesome-machine-learning-on-source-code](https://github.com/src-d/awesome-machine-learning-on-source-code): everything that we know about MLoSC.

- [ml](https://github.com/src-d/ml): MLoSC framework.

- [apollo](https://github.com/src-d/apollo): modular source code de-duplication research project.

- [kmcuda](https://github.com/src-d/kmcuda): lightning fast K-means and K-nearest neighbours on NVIDIA GPUs. It allows us to cluster 3 million samples, each 256 dimensions, into 1000 clusters in less than 20 minutes with the outstanding precision using two NVIDIA Titan X cards.

- [minhashcuda](https://github.com/src-d/minhashcuda): lightning fast Weighted MinHash on NVIDIA GPUs. This tool allowed us to scan all +17M git repositories in 30 minutes and find [1.5M](http://1.5m/) duplicates. The results were published on [data.world](https://data.world/vmarkovtsev/github-duplicate-repositories).

- [lapjv](https://github.com/src-d/lapjv): Jonker-Volgenant algorithm to solve linear sum assignment problems, accelerated with Intel AVX2 instruction set. It is capable of transforming 4096 t-SNE dots into 64x64 images in 2 minutes.

- [wmd-relax](https://github.com/src-d/wmd-relax): optimized Word Mover's Distance

- [hercules](https://github.com/src-d/hercules): Git repositories line burn down analysis command line tool built on top of source{d}'s [go-git](https://github.com/src-d/go-git), a Git client and server implementation in pure Go language.

- [sparkpickle](https://github.com/src-d/sparkpickle): the tool to read PySpar RDD files without having to install Spark.

### ROLE

- Strong computer science and machine learning background is essential for data science team members. You will be expected to be a passionate, skillful engineer who is able to produce amazing results quickly and reliably. Coding skills are important; we are using Python 3 and Go in our research and production prototyping. Besides, we occasionally code in C++ and CUDA. MLoSC shares common ideas with Natural Language Processing, so solid **NLP** knowledge is also required. **Deep Learning experience** is highly appreciated.


## CULTURE

- source{d} is a company for developers by developers. We firmly believe in always doing what's best for the community, not necessarily companies. "For developers" is the answer to any strategic question or dilemma in the company. Always For Developers.

- "By developers" is our identity. Everyone in the company is either a developer or has a developer/engineering mindset. We don't hire anyone who doesn't fit into this culture, it's the only way to make sure everyone understands developers and can always defend their interest.

- At the moment, we are 20+ people from 10 different countries working closely together from our office in Madrid, Spain. We are more than happy to sponsor you a visa and guide you and your family through the whole process if you decide to come to work from our office, but you may also choose to work remotely as part of our team does working from Portugal, Estonia, Russia, and others.

- At source{d}, we have a transparent salary policy which we feel strongly about it. Although a seniority level for every candidate will be determined during the last round of on-site interviews, one can expect that for a Senior Engineer salary ranges from €49.000 to €53.000. You can find our net amounts [here](https://cincodias.elpais.com/herramientas/calculadora-sueldo-neto/) (in Spanish only).

- Following the same level of transparency as with development process, all the above aspects of the work culture are documented and publicly available in our Guide at https://github.com/src-d/guide/.
