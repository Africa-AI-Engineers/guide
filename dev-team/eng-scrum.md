## Schedule

The sprint will last for 2 weeks.

- Planning meeting: every other Monday at 15:50
- Sprint review: every other Tuesday at 18:00
- Stand-ups meetings: every day at 10:00 (except planning meeting, sprint review, OSF and demo days)
- Demo: every other friday at 15:30
   - average 15 min. per team, 30 min. max. per team.
   - this must be a real demo, never show code.
   - do not interact with the terminal, browsers or other programs during the demo, record some videos and play them during the demo instead.
   - demo contents:
      - show the public implications of your work, not the internal details.
      - show results using benchmarks or before-and-after figures, graphs or screenshots. Plan the whole sprint according to this, don't wait until the day before the demo. 
- Deployment: Mondays after a demo.
   - data-retrival can deploy at any time.

## Tasks description and progress

Tasks are specified, at the beginning of the sprint, as issues in the [http://github.com/src-d/backlog](backlog repo).

Team members will create a followup issue in the relevant repo for the issue, where they can explain their planning and log their progress. That followup issue must mention the backlog issue so it can be easily located from backlog.
